# Learn-Python-The-Hard-Way

## This is my Repo for Learning Python
for some time now I've been wanting to learn Python. I've been interested in building AI and doing machine learning.

## What do you want to do ?
I want to main in Python only and I want to be able to build robotic arms and cool scripts that allows you to do really fun things.
## August 31  2020, What did you learn today ?
Currently discovering that there were two ways to insert a value into a string from a variable.
first one is using an F-string (f"this is a string {}") and as well just using string format method
( this is a format method -> format())
