# Learn-Python-The-Hard-Way

## This is my Repo for Learning Python
for some time now I've been wanting to learn Python. I've been interested in building AI and doing machine learning.

## What do you want to do ?
I want to main in Python only and I want to be able to build robotic arms and cool scripts that allows you to do really fun things.
## September 2 2020, What did you learn today ?
Currently on EX11 where we are learning about asking questions and in EX10 we were learning about Escape Sequence's
within strings. There are multiple sequences and as well that we can use triple quotes to make multi line notes. Continuing tomorrow with EX11
