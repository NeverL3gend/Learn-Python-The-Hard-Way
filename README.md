# Learn-Python-The-Hard-Way

## This is my Repo for Learning Python
for some time now I've been wanting to learn Python. I've been interested in building AI and doing machine learning.

## What do you want to do ?
I want to main in Python only and I want to be able to build robotic arms and cool scripts that allows you to do really fun things.
## September 21 2020, What did you learn today ?
Currently learning how to open/close/read/delete files while using python. Currently on EX16 but I need to go back to EX15 to get a better understanding of opening and reading files. I understand it but not as much as I would like. I've also decided that on weekends I will not code but will code Mon - fri and upload to GH. That is my current status.
