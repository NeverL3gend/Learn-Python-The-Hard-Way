# Learn-Python-The-Hard-Way

## This is my Repo for Learning Python
for some time now I've been wanting to learn Python. I've been interested in building AI and doing machine learning.

## What do you want to do ?
I want to main in Python only and I want to be able to build robotic arms and cool scripts that allows you to do really fun things.
## September 13 2020, What did you learn today ?
We got to the hard part today which is learning about modules ("features") in python. I was trying to under stand the variables and parameters while using the modules. using inputs for asking the questions and printing out the answer was a bit hard for me. Reason for being very difficult is due to
over thinking the solution when yet the book states to not to overthink

Tomorrow going to review the same EX13 before moving to EX14
