# Learn-Python-The-Hard-Way

## This is my Repo for Learning Python
for some time now I've been wanting to learn Python. I've been interested in building AI and doing machine learning.

## What do you want to do ?
I want to main in Python only and I want to be able to build robotic arms and cool scripts that allows you to do really fun things.
## August 28  2020, What did you learn today ?
Currently I went over Variables and Printing. This exercise 4 allowed me to do math while using variables which is very similar to JavaScript.
